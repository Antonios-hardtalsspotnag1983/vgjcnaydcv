Man, just stumbled outta G20 and my head's spinning. Like, whoa. The theater was a madhouse, popcorn everywhere, kinda wish I hadn't gone for the jumbo but hey, regrets eh? Back's killin' me from those too-tight seats, but that's what you do for a flick like this, ya know?

Okay, so lemme try to piece this together. There’s that scene, right at the beginning, it’s like if Michael Bay had a baby with a pile of neon lights. BOOM, CRASH, and I’m thinkin’ “did I wear my seatbelt?” Seriously, it felt like a rollercoaster for my eyes. The sound was so loud I swore it could 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬 a watermelon. The lead guy, what’s his name again? Anyway, he's got this wild look, like someone just told him his coffee went cold. It's intense, bro. There was this dialogue, I can’t remember exactly, but it was deep, like the kind of stuff philosophers probably whisper at parties.

> And then there's that car chase, oh man, just when you think it couldn’t get any crazier – whoosh – they pull off a flip only a donut cravin' bear in a cartoon could dream of. I was munching on popcorn and almost choked on a kernel. Whoever directed it has got this thing for chaos wrapped in speed. I mean, seriously, what even was that? Almost forgot there’s just some epic part with the explosion looking like someone got a firework display and shoved it in a blender. Pure madness.

The scenes blend together like trying to mix oil and water, but pretty in this weird, disorienting way. Yeah, someone asked if I could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for later - you know, one of those casual asks. Anyway, it’s totally worth it to, like, sit back and just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   unfold again, get all those juicy details you might’ve missed first time around.

I don’t know, there's this one point where I swear the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 starts speaking to you like it’s your therapist but also your worst enemy. Gotta love it though, kinda like trying to solve a Rubik's cube made of jello. I was just lookin' around at that point, the clatter of folks here and there, some guy even dropped his phone, what a mess.

Alright, need to shake this off. Get a cup of coffee, maybe, cuz my brain’s like a scrambled egg right now. Anyway, here's something that got in my notes, don’t know how:

```python
def review_g20( ):
    while  .is_confusing():
        𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩( )
    return Mind still exploding # oops
```

Oops, ignore above - feels like my mind’s still jumbled in code. Cool, talk soon, bro.
